## 📈 Workflow with CI/CD

This repository includes a **GitHub Actions workflow** for automated testing and deployment.

* Lint and test code automatically on every push
* Build and publish Docker images to container registries
* Deploy seamlessly to AWS EC2 or Kubernetes

Workflow file is located at:

```
.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml
```

## ⚠️ Important Notes

* **User Privacy:** Always obtain consent from candidates before recording video/audio.
* **Permissions:** Certain features like network lockdown may require **admin/root access**.
* **False Positives:** Unusual but innocent behaviors (e.g., nervousness) can trigger alerts — use the system alongside human review.
* **Hardware Variability:** Performance depends on webcam quality, lighting, and microphone clarity.

---

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

* Live dashboard for proctors with real-time activity visualization
* Browser extension to monitor on-screen activity
* Mobile support for candidates using tablets or phones
* AI-driven adaptive risk scoring
* Localization for multiple languages
